# Gym-Attendance-System
 The Gym Attendance System is a simple and user-friendly application for gym owners to register and track attendance. Users can input their mobile numbers, and the system will log the attendance along with the time. The application uses a CSV file to store attendance data and MySQL to retrieve member information.
